<p>PacerCMS developer inner.ground has recently completed the integration of an implementation of PHP's gettext function without the need for complex server configuration. He has also devised a way to extract all of the strings in the default template and throughout the Site Administrator so that they may be translated into countless other languages. We have posted the PO file to the subversion repository, where it will also be released with future versions of PacerCMS.</p>

<p>If you have a background in a language other than English and would like to be involved in localizing PacerCMS, please <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pacercms-discuss">contact us</a>.</p>
