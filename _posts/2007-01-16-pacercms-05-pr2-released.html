<p>The latest preview release is now available for download from our Google Code repository. This release fixes a bug in the configuration file writer, as well as issues for any host that had <tt>register_globals</tt> turned off in their PHP installation. We are in the process of updating <a href="http://pacercms.sourceforge.net/index.php/screenshots/">screenshots</a> in preparation for our 0.5 release later this month.</p>
