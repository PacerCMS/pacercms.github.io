<p>The latest stable release of PacerCMS is now available for download. We would like to thank user inner.ground for his fantastic work on developing the internationalization capabilities found in this release, and Eric Lemoine for creating the first localization of PacerCMS in French. This release also introduces a database upgrade tool, which will aide in making sure future updates to PacerCMS run smoothly. Editors can also now "Preview" an issue's front page, sections and individual articles prior to to setting it as the "current" issue through the issue manager.</p>
<p>As always, we invite <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pacercms-discuss">feedback</a> on our software and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pacercms-discuss">suggestions</a> on how it may be improved. We are also <a href="http://pacercms.sourceforge.net/index.php/2007/10/13/seeking-developers/">always seeking developers</a> to help improve our project.</p>
