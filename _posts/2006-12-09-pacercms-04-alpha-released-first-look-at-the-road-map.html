title: PacerCMS 0.4 Alpha Released; First Look at the Road Map
excerpt: It has been just over five months since we released our first packaged version
  of PacerCMS on SourceForge, and next month the project will turn a year old. The
  project has had right at 200 downloads so far in its infancy, and still has not
  shed the "Alpha" tag line. Here is a look at the goals moving forward.

<p>It has been just over five months since we released our first packaged version of PacerCMS on SourceForge, and next month the project will turn a year old. The project has had right at 200 downloads so far in its infancy, and still has not shed the "Alpha" tag line. Here is a look at the goals moving forward.</p>
<p>PacerCMS <code>0.4 Alpha</code> marks the final release in the "Alpha" phase of the project, barring major bug fixes or other such concerns. Our next release, <code>0.5 Beta</code>, should look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installation Script</strong> - Creating configuration file and creating database tables</li>
<li><strong>Template Engine </strong> - Likely using <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a> for public templates</li>
<li><strong>Developer Documentation</strong> - Framework overview for easier coding back to the project</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>After <code>0.5 Beta</code> is released, we will get on a more common numbering system for versions/naming. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pacercms-discuss">Join our Google Group</a> to offer your thoughts on the next phase of development.</p>
