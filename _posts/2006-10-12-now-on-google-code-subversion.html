title: Now on Google Code Subversion
excerpt: PacerCMS will be released via your standard ZIP file every so often here
  on SourceForge. However, the "live" development will be done with Google Code. Aside
  from being a part of both of these great communities, this was the most mutually
  beneficial way to span both camps.
