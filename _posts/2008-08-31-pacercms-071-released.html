<p>Labor Day marks the ceremonial end of summer, and that means that most student publications are kicking back into high gear. We extend a special welcome to new staff members and wish you a successful year! PacerCMS has a maintenance release available, primarily addressing an issue within the Section Manager that was preventing the creation of new sections. There are a few other minor tweaks here and there throughout the codebase to improve performance and reliability.</p>
<h3>This Release (Subversion R139)</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix error when attempting to add sections (#<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pacercms/issues/detail?id=26&can=1">26</a>)</li>
<li>Various bug fixes and minor enhancements from the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pacercms-discuss">Developer's List</a></li><br />
</ul></p>
