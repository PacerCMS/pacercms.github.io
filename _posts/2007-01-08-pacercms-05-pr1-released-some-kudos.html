<p>We are proud to announce the availability of PacerCMS 0.5 PR1. This preview release gives you the opportunity to start using the new template engine and installer included with PacerCMS. As with most open source software, we have a few groups we would like to thank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> developers</strong> for creating a powerful yet simple installer that our version could "clone." If you look closely, you will find other WordPress-inspired tools (JS Quick Tags and autop(), for example) littered throughout the code.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> developers </strong>for a template engine that makes customizing PacerCMS quite a bit easier without worrying about breaking the PHP code.</li>
<li><strong>You</strong>, for clicking the download link below and giving it a spin.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Let us know what you think of the "new stuff" in our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pacercms-discuss">PacerCMS Developers Group</a>. This download package will not count toward our total number, so your feedback is really important to us.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Google Code's download system is back online. The link now directs there.</p>
